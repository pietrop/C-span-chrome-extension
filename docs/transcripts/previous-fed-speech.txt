the government's involvement in va healthcare is the most effective way of honoring our nation's commitment to our veterans. That does not mean that veterans should not have the ability to go into the private sector when it's in their best interest when the care is better or specialized care is available that's not in the va. I think we all believe that should be available. Watch book tv every weekend on c-span2. Federal reserve chair jerome howell announced a bbfollowing the announcement he took reporters questions regarding the action and the economic outlook. Good afternoon and welcome. My colleagues at the federal reserve and I are dedicated to serving the American people. We do this by steadfastly pursuing the goals that Congress has given us. Maximum employment and stable prices. We are committed to making the best decisions we can based on facts and objective analysis. Today we decided to lower the interest rates for the third time this year. We took this step to help keep the U.S. Economy strong in the face of global developments and to provide insurance against ongoing risks. As I will explain shortly, the policy adjustments we've made since last year providing and will continue to provide meaningful support to the economy. We believe monetary policy is in a good place. The U.S. Economy is in its 11th year of expansion. The baseline outlook remains favorable. The overall economy is growing at a moderate rate, household spending continues to be strong supported by healthy job market rising incomes and solid consumer confidence. In contrast, business investment and exports remain weak and manufacturing output has declined over the past year. Sluggish growth abroad and trade developments have been weighing on those sectors. Looking ahead, we continue to expect the economy to expand at a moderate rate reflecting solid household spending and support financial conditions. The job market remains strong. Unemployment rate has been near half-century lows for year and and a half. The pace of job gains has eased this year but remain solid. We expected some slowing after last year's strong takes. Participation in the labor force by people in the prime working years has been increasing. And wages have been rising particularly for lower paying jobs. People who live and work in lower and middle income communities tell us that many who have struggled to find work are now getting opportunities to add new and better chapters to their lives. This underscores for us the importance of the sustaining the expansion so that the strong job market reaches more of those left behind. Inflation continues to run low our symmetric two percent objective. Over the 12 months through August, total pce inflation was 1.4 percent and core inflation was 1.8 percent. Inflation pressures remain muted and indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are at the lower end of their historic ranges. We are mindful that continued below target inflation could lead to a non-welcomed downward slide in long-term inflation expectations. However, against the backdrop of the strong economy and support of monetary policies we expect inflation will rise to two percent. Overall, we continue to see sustained expansion of economic activity a strong labor market and inflation in the area symmetric two percent objective as most likely. While this has been the outlook for quite some time, our views about path of interest rate that will best achieve these outcomes have changed significantly over the past year. As I mentioned, weakness in global growth and trade developments have weighed on the economy and posed ongoing risks. These factors in conjunction with muted inflation pressures have led us to lower our assessment of the appropriate level of the federal funds rate over the past year. In both July and September we reduce the target rate for the federal funds rate by one quarter percentage point and we did so again today bringing the range to 1.5 and 1 3/4 percent. The policy adjustments we've made today will continue to provide significant support for the economy. Since monetary policy operates with a leg, the full effects of these adjustments on economic growth job market and inflation will be realized over time. We see the current stance of monetary policy is likely to remain appropriate.as long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with her outlook. And inflation near the two percent objective. We believe monetary policy is in a good place to achieve these outcomes. Looking ahead, we will be monitoring the effects of our policy actions along with other information bearing on the outlook. As we assess the appropriate path of the target range for the fed funds rate. Of course, if developments emerge, it caused a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly. Policy is not preset course. In the end with a few words about our technical monetary policy operations, in January we made the key decision to continue to implement monetary policy and an ample reserves regime. In that operating framework we control the federal funds rate primarily by setting our administered rates.two frequent interventions to active the supply reserves. In the transition to the efficient and effective level of reserves in this regime, we slowed the gradual decline in our balance sheet in March and stopped in July. In response to the funding pressures and money markets that emerged in mid-september we concluded it would be appropriate to maintain over time a level of reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early September of this year. To achieve this ample level we announced October 11 that we would purchase treasury bills at least into the second quarter of next year as well as continue temporary open market operations at least through January. These actions are purely technical measures to support the effective implementation of monetary policy as we continue to learn about the appropriate level of reserves. They do not represent a change in the stance of monetary policy. In particular. Our treasury bill purchasers should not be confused with large-scale asset purchase programs that we deployed after the financial crisis. In those programs we purchase longer-term securities to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and ease broader financial conditions. In contrast, increasing the supply of reserves by purchasing treasury bills only alters the mix of sort short-term assets by the public and should not affect the demographic demand and supply for longer-term securities or financial conditions more broadly. Thank you, I will be happy to take your questions. Michael mckee with bloomberg radio and television. The question is, is this it? Do you consider rates to be accommodative enough to achieve your goal of sustaining the expansion and as far as global wall street primary question, what kind of change in the economy would cause you to reassess some sort of significant deterioration in what? What we've said to repeat is that we see the current stance of policy is likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with her outlook. We say that really because both the performance of the economy and the stance of policy. The performance and economy has been particularly the household sector has been strong and resilient with low unemployment, attractive levels of job creation, wages will be up, labor force participation will be up household competence and solid gains in many measures of consumer spending. The manufacturing sector particularly manufacturing and investment and exports have been weaker but overall we've seen moderate growth with inflation moving up we see the outlook for more of the same we also see the risks of the outlook. As perhaps having moved in a positive direction over the course of this period although some remain to be seen. That's the economy, turning to policy, we will do stance a policy over the course of the year to more accommodate stance and after cuts of the last three meetings it's now in the range of 1.51 three quarters percent we feel that policy is well-positioned to support the outlook that I described. So you ask what it would take to move and as I mentioned. We will be watching all factors and if developments emerge that cause the material reassessment of her outlook we would respond accordingly but that's what it would take a material reassessment of our outlook. We would be looking at a full range of data with the economy and the risks of the outlook. And I've given you a sense of what our outlook is, it's for moderate growth, strong labor market and inflation near two percent objective. If something happens to cause us to material reassess the outlook that's what would cause us to change our views on the appropriate sense of policy. Heather long from the Washington post. You just said that the risks to the outlook are moving in a positive direction, and wondering if you could specify is that on trade or other matters? This morning we obviously learned we now had two quarters of contracting business investments which would seem to be moving the outlook in the other directions. The principal risks we've been monitoring have been really slowing global growth and trade policy developments. As well as muted inflation pressure I was referring there to trade developments. We have phase 1 potential agreement with China which if signed and put into effect could have the effect of reducing trade tensions and producing uncertainty and that would bode well we think for business confidence and perhaps activity over time. That has the potential for being an improvement in the risk picture. Brexit I would say as well it appears that the risk of a no deal brexit seems to have materialized materially decline, I think both situations there's plenty of risk left but I have to say the risk seem to have subsided. You ask about business investment, that's right, business investment has been weakened, today's reading was weak as well. It was brought across equipment and and other parts of business fixed investment were weak. That's consistent with what we have seen but that's the economy we had this year. What we have had is an economy where the consumer is driving growth and personal consumption expenditures were almost 3 percent in this quarter in this first reading for the quarter. Overall we see the economy as having been resilient to the winds that have been blowing this year. There is a concern that I sometimes hear with businesses of cut investment are they going to turn around and cut employment if they continue to be concerned. That is a risk we been monitoring but we don't see it yet. We don't see the rising initial claims or layoffs or anything like that but the risk you mentioned the weakness in the manufacturing export investment business investment parts of the economy getting into the consumer side, we really don't see that we continue to see is good job creation, unemployment has declined again in the household survey is now at 50 year low, it's been very close to 50 year lows for 18 months now. It's a very positive, the consumer facing companies we talked to in the vast network of contacts report that consumers are doing well and focused on the good job market and rising incomes and that the principal focus. That's the thing that's pushing the economy forward and doesn't seem to be have been affected so far by weakness in the other areas. You have previously compared this great cutting cycle to the insurance cuts in the 90s. In both of those instances, the greenspan said to take these cuts back after a while. They raise cuts again fairly quickly. I'm curious what the bonuses for doing that in this cycle? What would make you decide it's appropriate to raise interest rates again? The reason why we raise interest rates is because generally, it's because we see inflation as moving up or in danger of moving up significantly and we really don't see that now. Inflation moved down in the first quarter of this year we thought that was due to some extent to it egocentric or bb it turns out to be the case was moved back up but it seems to be settling in the low two percent. We really don't see that risk and inflation expectations also moved down and sideways both surveys and market-based over the course of really the recent months and we think inflation expectations are very important in driving actual inflation and we are strongly committed to achieving our two percent inflation objective on symmetric basis we think it's essential we do that. We are not thinking about raising rates right now. There obviously will be times in the future where that will be appropriate but what we are they really thinking now is that our current stance of policy is appropriate and will remain so as long as the outlook is broadly in keeping with our expectations. Mr. Chairman, not to make light of it I'm a little bit b bcan you help me out with the appropriate understanding of the word appropriate. The statement says that the community is going to monitor the application of incoming information for the outlook as if assesses the appropriate path of the target range. That tells me you could go either way. You came in and use the word appropriate that the current rate is likely to remain appropriate which means you are on hold. How I walk away from this, what should we walk away from this believing what appropriate means? You want to hold and need to be proved wrong but you should remain on hold? Or really could go either way? We think the current stance of policy is likely to remain appropriate. Likely to remain appropriate. As long as incoming information about the economy is broadly consistent with our outlook. Which is a positive one of moderate economic growth, strong labor market and inflation moving close to two percent. That's what we are saying about that we also say of course if developments emerge that cause material reassessment of that outlook we would respond accordingly. That's really how we are thinking about it. I can't point to one data point or one thing that would change her mind, it really would be a reassessment of material reassessment of our overall applicants which is what I describe. Why isn't the phrase bbif that's the sense of the committee. There is a lot of practice in science and history in terms of how much you put in the actual postmeeting statement as opposed to what we say in the press conference statement. It's a judgment call. I'm saying it now. Nick demirel's with the wall street journal. Described in the recent slides, and inflation expectations as welcome. You can say the inflation expectations are very bwhat if anything with the committee be prepared to do to address this slide in inflation expectations if it continued? We do think inflation expectations are quite essential, quite sensual in our framework of how we think about inflation. We need them to be accurate and a level that is consistent with our symmetric two percent infringement goal. We think that we need a policy in a way that supports the outcome. That's what we're doing now. Also as part of our review we are looking at potential innovations, changes to the way we think about things. Changes to the framework that will lead us that would be more supportive of achieving inflation two percent on a symmetric two percent basis over time. That's at the very heart of what we are doing the review. It's too early to announce decisions.we are in the middle of thinking about ways that we can make that symmetric two percent inflation objective more credible by achieving symmetric two percent inflation. It comes down to using your policy tools to achieve two percent inflation. That is the thing that must happen for credibility in this area. We are in the middle, really quite in the middle of it now. My thinking is still that it will run into the middle of next year. The changes to monetary policy frameworks have been, they don't happen quickly. Inflation targeting took many years to evolve I don't think it will take many years I think we will wrap it up around the middle of next year would be my guess. How big of a change to monetary policy would there be if you get uncertainty cleared up a specifically that phase 1 trade deal finished in bb ratified.how big of a change could that be to the monetary policy when you remove the uncertainty the presidents would rise could there be a point I guess my question is, how big of an impact on military policy would moving the uncertainty. I would say that if we were to have a sustained reduction in trade tensions broad reduction in trade tensions and resolution of these uncertainties, that would bode well for business sentiment, which is trade uncertainty has been weighing on business sentiment in our judgment and the judgment of many analysts. Ultimately it could affect activity. I wouldn't expect that the effects on activity or confidence would be immediate or would be immediate effects in economic activity I think it would take some time after the recent things but I think it would be quite positive over time. Come back to the question of raising rates. It's really about inflation and we have it yet we just touched two percent core inflation to pick one measure just touched it for a few months and then we have fallen back. I think we would need to see a significant move up in inflation that persistent before would consider raising rates to address conflation concerns. The other thing you talked about in this review is the gains that a super high pressure labor market have, particularly for the communities you are talking but he mentioned it just now when you're talking, is that something you are identifying and that something the fed is learning more about this year? Why not continue to push those gains particularly for people who are reentering the labor force. I think we are doing that. I think we've made very substantial adjustments to policy over the course of this year. We entered the year expecting some further rate increases went to patient now inca rate cuts, it's a very substantial shift and the effects will be felt over time. We feel like those shifts are appropriate in supporting the equity of the outcome you're talking about. Which are the continuing strong labor market, continuing strong job creation, bb
you describe the shift you made so far was just about trade uncertainty it was about specifically these kinds of high pressure labor gains you talked
we said it was about three things, it's been about a slowing global economy, you have a synchronized slowdown in economic activity around the globe. We've had trade policy uncertainty which we think has been weighing on activity and investment. In inflation which we called up the risk of inflation running persistently below two percent we been doing it to address all those things. I would say the gains in the labor market have been great to see if particularly the fact that people at the lower end of wages have been getting most of the benefit of most of the wage gains in the last couple years that's a great thing. From our listens events that we've been hearing from people who live and work in low to moderate income communities that this is the best labor market they've seen in their lifetime. And by the way, there's also still so many people who were still not in the labor market yet and there's a lot more that can be done there. We have to think about the whole economy and those gains are positive, we call them out they are a reason for us to want to extend the expansion that something we are committed
doing.

>> The fed's balance sheets, you all recently resumed purchases of treasury bills and I was just wondering how long do you expect that to continue and given the fact that the repo operations seems like the fed has increased the amount of liquidity that is ingesting into the system do you still feel like it's just that there is not enough reserves in the system? Do you feel like you have a good sense of what's going on? On how long, what we said is that we expect purchases to continue at least into the second quarter of next year. He said that temporary open market operations we expect to continue I think at least until the end of January. Through January. In terms of the causes, there is a lot of forensic work going on by us and market participants and all kinds of analysts and one thing is that we think we need reserves to be back up to the level minimum level of reserves we can have during the various fluctuations that you see with reserves. It's something like 1.45 trillion or a little higher. That's the level in early September. We will be adding reserves to get back to that place. There are also one thing that was surprising about the episode was that liquidity didn't seem to flow as one might have expected. We surveyed the banks carefully about what was their lowest comfortable level of reserves. Many banks were well above that level did not take that excess cash and invested in the repo market at much higher rates. They just didn't do that. The question is why under the things we can do that would the adjustments we can make that would allow liquidity to flow more easily in the system without in any way sacrificing safety and sound or financial stability. Those are not things that can happen to address the situation in the short term but a range of things we are looking at as well. Howard schneider with bb thanks for the questions. I will to see if you could give us a more texture on what the strongest or most important case is for feeling you know taken adequate insurance. Is it the response you are seeing and housing in other parts of the economy arguably through the cuts made so far? Is it the fact that the risk environment altered globally has shifted a bit and dated a bit? Or is it something different in the financial markets the fact that the yield curve has written itself etc. It's really, there isn't any one factor. It's really the whole range of economic data and also what we see as about our extensive policy which we believe is the appropriate stance. It's both of those. If you look at the performance of the economy through this the consumer sector has been quite resilient. The witness today's gp report and all the things I went through earlier suggested that continues to be strong. We know the manufacturing investments create export sector it has been weak, that continues but nonetheless overall we have economy that is showing moderate growth. We think that today's session, we are now at 1.5 b1.75percent. We believe that's an accommodative level and a level that will support the outlook that we have. This is kind of a one legged recovery that unless you get some impetus from everything, exports, investment, that it's going to weaken further at some point. We don't see evidence of that but what we see is that the consumer sector continues strong. Low initial claims, it's obviously a very broad range of data. We also see now more clearly the effects of more accommodative monetary policy on various kinds of consumer activity. You are seeing strong durable goods sales. You are seeing housing contributed to growth in first commonwealth. 2/10 I think this quarter. You are seeing retail sales retail sales number, the pce number as I mentioned in today's release with 2.9 percent. A big broadleaved monetary policy is also supporting household spending and homebuying by keeping the labor market strong, keeping workers incomes rising and keeping consumer confidence at high levels. You are talking about how the lower rates of effective consumer behavior, is there a concern there is less potency on the business investment side that you are in effect pushing on a string? I think monetary policy work through the channels that we understand I think the effects are clear and what we think of as the interest rate sensitive sectors which are the some of the ones I mentioned. I think interest rates are a factor in business investment but I don't believe they are the main factor and main driver. What one would like to see to support greater manufacturing activity business investment experts would be a global recovery. And yes there's a lot of monetary policy accommodation and some fiscal combination in the global economy now.not here but perhaps elsewhere and that should support growth in the global economy and resolution of our trade issues would contribute to that over time as well. You mentioned this a couple times and what you heard from people about how it's benefited disadvantage or lower income workers the hot job market we have. Has the fed thought about institutionalizing something like taking in some of the input from people you don't always hear from. Has there been thought of bringing folks in more regularly? We think that federalism has been a great success for us. I'm sure we will repeat it in fact, I would imagine this entire monetary policy review will become institutionalized and be done every few years. I would say this, in the beige book we talk to educational institutions, healthcare institutions, community groups, labor groups, it's not bball the groups are also represented on the boards of our regional banks. We also need quite regularly the aggregate but we also talk about groups that have experienced that yet so we tried to remind ourselves that we serve everybody. Steve matthews with bloomberg, you mentioned housing and today's gdp data when you look at that, do you believe that you have achieved a soft landing or achieving a soft landing in the sense that it we are moving to trend growth for the rest of the year
next year?

>> That's our outlook overall for moderate growth of around two percent which is pretty close. It could be better or worse, you never say you've achieved it but that's our outlook. We feel like our current stanza policy is appropriate as long as that remains broadly our outlook. Setting aside market expectations for today's rate cuts, obviously 90% are expected this would happen today. Can you tell us a little bit more about the rationale behind moving at this particular meeting as opposed to waiting six weeks and cutting a December and if there was discussion about that around the table. I think this seems to be the right movement, you can see that we had our usual range of perspectives, range of views but in the end we had a strong vote in favor of the action. I strongly believe it's the right action. I strongly believe that the actions we taken over the course of this year have been the right things to do for this economy. Enter supporting economic growth and will do so in the future. It seems that the differences across the country there are different regions reacting differently to the China trade and some regions are much weaker than others. There's an urban rural divide. Probable walked her into this policy? Possibly monetary policy is famously a blunt instrument. Obviously we can't raise interest someplace in lower than other places. But we are very conscious the first thing is to know to understand that and we call that out in one of our recent monetary reports to Congress in the rural urban disparities in employment and growth and all kinds of things and health outcomes. It's a big add drawing different set of differences we don't really have the tools to address that but we call things out that are important to our economy that we might not be might not have the right tools to best address them but we call them out because we are spending all of our time with the economy and those are issues that May be have to be addressed by legislatures. And at the national level in the state level. Are you asking Congress to do something now? Or will you ask them to do something down the road? I'm not asking Congress to do anything right now. I sometimes have noted that it would be appropriate. Put it this way, we do what we do, which is we are assigned a job which is maximum employment and stable prices. We do financial stability we do bank regulation. The U.S. Economy faces significant longer-term challenges around potential growth around labor participation around disparities of income and wealth. Around all kinds of things. Those are issues for Congress. They are not issues for us. If you really want the same economy to be all it can be an raise the potential growth rate of the United States you need proper monetary policy but really it's not monetary policy, blitz fiscal policy that supports inclusive growth. Doggedly with "l.a. Times". I think you said that the primary positive development and risk to the outlook was on trade and specifically the prospect for phase 1 agreement with China. To keep the ups and downs of the trade in several truces and tentative deals have fallen through are you concerned about adopting monetary policy guidance dependent on support in the winds of the trade negotiation? That's not how I would characterize it. I just noted that it might be that there has been progress there. Toward away from bad outcomes and confrontational outcomes. It seems like there is the makings of a possible settlement. I didn't say we were banking that in but I'm noting that's the case as with brexit still quite uncertain what would be the result of the election and what the ultimate result would be what I would say the tail risk of a nonnegotiated no deal brexit seems to have decreased just as I would say that the situation trade negotiations with China seems to have taken a step closer to resolution. That's all I'm saying. If it doesn't work out then we would be back making monetary policies. That's one factor among many factors. If we see if we if things happen that cause us to materially reassess the outlook, change our assessment of the outlook and material way then we would act accordingly. Bbthey pointed out many timesin the past the rising inequality and how it could be a factor behind the sluggish growth in light of the recent outcome of this trike after general motors do you see the union having a road to play helping to lower and middle incomes and promoting more shared growth on that? Not for us to say what the appropriate labor arrangements will be. I will just say on the general motors strike it's likely to have taken away a couple tenths of growth this quarter. That's likely to come back maybe over the first half of next year. I think it's good to see it settle vote or comment on what the appropriate labor arrangements are, that's a little bit far afield from our task here. Thank you. Wondering if you would categorize the current stance of monetary policy as accommodative or if it's just neutral was lower than we thought at this time last year. Secondly, we are now two years removed from the tax cuts and jobs act. You mentioned a fiscal policy and supporting long-term growth is it fair to say that the tax cuts and jobs act work the way it was supposed to? What was your first question? Bb
okay. If you look at where the federal funds raised trading it should be in the middle or lower half of the range of 150 b175.that means the real rate is probably modestly below zero. I think my own sense would be that that somewhat accommodative policy. I would say that there is a range of plausible estimates of what the neutral rates of interest is. I think many of those who make such estimates have moved their estimate down over the course of many years. In that process continues. Nonetheless, that seems to be very likely to be an accommodative stanza policy and an appropriate stance given the situation we are in with continuing downside risks. I wanted to ask about financial stability risks. Recently the ims and global policymakers has been expressing concerns over the high level of bbas rates get lower in the U.S. And around the world, are you more worried about financial stability risks. We monitor financial stability risks very carefully all the time. It's what we do since the financial crisis. Currently we don't see large imbalances. This long expansion is notable for the lack of large financial imbalances like the one we've seen certainly before the crisis happened. We have a four-part framework will quickly mention the first is leveraging the financial system which is low by historical standards. The second is funding risk which is the risk of bbandthat risk is also quite low for banks but also for the nonbanking financial sector. If you look at asset prices, we see some high asset prices but not broadly across a range we'll see bubbles and that kind of thing. And that leaves the fourth which is leverage in the nonfinancial sector and that's households and businesses. But households we don't see leverage we see them actually getting in very good shape financially in the aggregate, plenty of households are not in great shape financially but in the aggregate the household sector is a very good place that leaves businesses, which is where the issue has been. Leverage among corporations and other forms of business private businesses is historically high. We been monitoring it carefully and taking appropriate steps. That's what I would say but corporate debt is one part of a larger part of our framework and it is something we are paying quite a bit of attention to and it's been part of the last couple of shared national credit exams and we been monitoring it carefully and taking appropriate action. Have the problems in the repo market led you look into whether the liquidity and capital requirements for banks are too high? Is that something that the feds might review? I think the most important basic thing is to get the level of reserves back up the reserves dumb reserves move up and down with some volatility. We don't want them to move below the level they were at in the beginning of September. Which is between 1.45 and 1.5 trillion. That's the main thing that the first thing. We are on a path to do that between temporary open market operations and our bill purchases. In addition to that, we are looking at is a big complicated marketplace and one of the surprises was that bankston had told us that the lowest comfortable level of reserves was here they were well above that and yet they didn't deploy that liquidity when they were seen to be great opportunities to do that. That didn't happen. Why is that? We are doing careful analysis of that. You ask would be lower capital liquidity requirements because of this? I don't think so. I don't think that's where this goes. I think where it might go is to look at intraday liquidity. Which used to be a common thing is to be a common thing for banks to have intraday liquidity from what's called daylight overdrafts. That's something we can look at. There are a few technical things we can look at that would perhaps make the liquidity that we have, which we think was ample in the financial system move more freely and be more liquid. Those are things we would do but only if we can do it without compromising safety or soundness or financial stability step. Thank you very much chairman powell. [indiscernable] given the low inflation, even in this country, do you think there seems to be a higher possibility that lower inflation expectation will remain going forward? Do you think japan -like situation or japanese ba lowerinflation and interest rates the U.S. Is getting trumped by their explanation of the situation. We of course have watched the situation in japan and the situation in Europe. We note that there are significant as inflationary pressures around the world. We don't think we are exempt from those. Of course if you look at our current inflation performance, it hasn't been anything like what we have seen in those other places. But we don't think, we don't think we are exempt from those pressures. We are therefore strongly committed to having inflation expectations anchored at a level that is consistent with a symmetric two percent inflation objective. That's what we are committed to and will use tools to achieve so we take the risk very seriously. The risk isn't that inflation might run a couple tenths below two percent, the risk is that what we have seen is other economies getting on at this inflationary path and it's been very hard for them to get off once inflation expectations start sliding down inflation moves down you have less interest rates moved as well because there's inflation component in interest rates and we think the right thing to do is to do what we can now to hold and move inflation expectations up so that they are squarely and firmly anchored at a level x consistent with two percent inflation. Another type of balance sheet question but not necessarily focused on the repo crunch, there was discussion before that that maybe we should bbfeds should move to a neutral balance sheet trying to remove some agency securities on the balance sheet and replace them with short-term treasuries. I haven't really heard an update on the composure of the composition of the balance sheet for right now I'm just wondering if it's actively thinking about that right now and if so, what we might expect to hear something on that? It's an issue but it's not an issue we are currently working on or reaching a decision or anything like that. The question of long-run maturity composition of about she is a big one and it's one we will return to overtime but not indefinitely. Bb [inaudible]
this morning the president tweeted that we are seeing the greatest economy in American history, I just wanted to see if the what he made of that characterization? I will maintain my longtime practice of not commenting on anything any elected official would say. But thank you.
